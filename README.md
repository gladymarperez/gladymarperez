## Hi, I am Glady

- ðŸ”­ I solve data wrangling puzzles in sparklyr and Databricks at the Kirby Institute, UNSW
- ðŸŒ± I learn something new from every dataset, always expanding my tidyverse and English vocabularies. Whether itâ€™s a new function in R, a tip on GitHub, or a new English word, Iâ€™m keen on learning and improving and piping my dreams into this hostile world.
