## Hi, I am Glady!

- ğŸ”­ I solve big & small data wrangling puzzles in sparklyr/tidyverse and Databricks/R at the Kirby Institute, UNSW.
- ğŸŒ±  Whether itâ€™s a new function in R, a tip on GitHub, or a new English word, Iâ€™m always keen on learning, improving, and piping (|>) my dreams into this hostile world!
